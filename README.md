# Memebot

Memebot is a small utility chat bot designed to spread memes over group chats.

Memebot is currently supported on two platforms:
-Facebook
-Kik

Memebot scans each message event for "trigger words" and if detected, sends the corresponding response.

TODO:
-Have a centralized meme scanning system so that both platforms can have the same meme triggers and respond with their respective image urls.

-Document the code
